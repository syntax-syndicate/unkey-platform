# Test Scenarios for v2_ratelimit_set_override

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that sets rate limit overrides.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully create a new rate limit override
- [ ] Successfully update an existing rate limit override
- [ ] Set override with custom limit
- [ ] Set override with custom duration
- [ ] Set override for a specific identity
- [ ] Set override with specific name/resource
- [ ] Set override with explicit expiration time
- [ ] Verify response structure matches specification
- [ ] Verify all expected fields are returned in the response
- [ ] Set override that is more permissive than default
- [ ] Set override that is more restrictive than default

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to set override with invalid limit (negative or zero)
- [ ] Attempt to set override with invalid duration (too small)
- [ ] Attempt to set override with non-existent identity ID
- [ ] Attempt to set override with invalid identity ID format
- [ ] Attempt to set override with empty name
- [ ] Attempt to set override with invalid expiration (in the past)
- [ ] Attempt to set override with malformed request body
- [ ] Attempt to set override with missing required fields

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to set override without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to set override with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to set override with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to set override with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to set override for a different workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow setting overrides:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission for managing rate limits
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify override record is correctly inserted/updated in database
- [ ] Verify all override fields are stored correctly
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is stored correctly
- [ ] Verify timestamps are correctly set
- [ ] Verify existing override is properly updated (not duplicated)
- [ ] Verify audit log entry is created for the operation

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Set override with very high limit values
- [ ] Set override with extremely short duration (minimum allowed)
- [ ] Set override with extremely long duration (maximum allowed)
- [ ] Set override with name containing special characters
- [ ] Update override immediately after creating it
- [ ] Set multiple overrides for the same identity with different names
- [ ] Set override with expiration very close to current time

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Attempt concurrent setting of the same override
- [ ] Test race conditions between setting and using the override
- [ ] Test concurrent updates to different overrides

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for setting overrides
- [ ] Test performance under load
- [ ] Test setting many overrides in succession
- [ ] Test setting overrides during peak rate limit activity

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly set override is immediately effective in rate limiting
- [ ] Verify override takes precedence over default rate limit settings
- [ ] Verify override is correctly returned by get override endpoint
- [ ] Verify override appears in list overrides endpoint
- [ ] Verify deleting an override restores default behavior
- [ ] Verify expired overrides no longer affect rate limiting
- [ ] Verify metrics and monitoring correctly track override usage
