# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_list_permissions

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that lists permissions.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] List permissions with default pagination (no cursor provided)
- [ ] List permissions with pagination (cursor provided)
- [ ] List permissions with limit parameter
- [ ] List permissions when none exist (should return empty array)
- [ ] List permissions when exactly one exists
- [ ] List permissions when multiple exist
- [ ] Verify response structure includes correct pagination details
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is correctly associated with returned permissions
- [ ] Verify permissions are returned with correct descriptions

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with negative/zero limit
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with excessively large limit
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with invalid cursor format
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with malformed request body
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with invalid filter parameters (if supported)

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to list permissions without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to list permissions from a different workspace (should not be accessible)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow permission listing:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permissions for listing permissions
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify results match actual database records
- [ ] Verify correct ordering of results
- [ ] Verify pagination works correctly with database queries
- [ ] Verify no sensitive/internal data is exposed in results
- [ ] Verify only permissions from the authenticated workspace are returned

## Edge Cases

- [ ] List permissions at pagination boundaries
- [ ] Performance with large number of permissions
- [ ] Handle deleted permissions correctly (if soft delete is used)
- [ ] Correct handling of Unicode characters in permission data
- [ ] List permissions with varying description lengths

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for listing with varying numbers of permissions
- [ ] Test concurrent requests for permission listings
- [ ] Verify performance with different pagination sizes
- [ ] Test performance when filtering or sorting is applied

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created permissions appear in listing
- [ ] Verify deleted permissions do not appear in listing
- [ ] Verify updated permissions show current data
- [ ] Verify relationship with other endpoints (get permission details, etc.)
- [ ] Verify permissions used in roles are correctly reflected

## Pagination Testing

- [ ] Verify first page returns expected cursor for next page
- [ ] Verify last page indicates end of results
- [ ] Verify all permissions can be retrieved through pagination
- [ ] Verify no duplicate permissions across pages
- [ ] Verify consistency when permissions are added/removed during pagination
- [ ] Test with minimum page size
- [ ] Test with maximum page size
