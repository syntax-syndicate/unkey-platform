# Test Scenarios for v2_liveness

This document outlines test scenarios for the API liveness endpoint that checks the health of the service.

## Basic Functionality

- [ ] Endpoint returns HTTP 200 OK when service is healthy
- [ ] Endpoint returns appropriate status information in the response body
- [ ] Response includes a requestId for debugging purposes

## Response Format

- [ ] Response structure matches the expected OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Content-Type header is set to "application/json"
- [ ] Response is properly formatted JSON

## Dependencies

- [ ] Endpoint correctly reports health when all dependencies are available
- [ ] Endpoint behavior is defined when database is unavailable
- [ ] Endpoint behavior is defined when other critical services are down

## Performance

- [ ] Endpoint responds within acceptable latency threshold (e.g., <100ms)
- [ ] Endpoint maintains performance under high load
- [ ] Endpoint does not consume excessive resources

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Behavior when accessed with incorrect HTTP method (non-GET requests)
- [ ] Behavior when accessed with unexpected query parameters
- [ ] Behavior during application startup/initialization

## Security

- [ ] Verify endpoint doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Verify endpoint doesn't require authentication (should be accessible for health checks)
- [ ] Ensure endpoint is rate-limited to prevent DoS attacks

## Operational

- [ ] Endpoint is accessible from Kubernetes health/readiness probes
- [ ] Endpoint correctly integrates with monitoring systems
- [ ] Logging is appropriate (not excessive for frequent health checks)
