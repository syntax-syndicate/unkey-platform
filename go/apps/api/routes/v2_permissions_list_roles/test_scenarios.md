# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_list_roles

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that lists roles.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] List roles with default pagination (no cursor provided)
- [ ] List roles with pagination (cursor provided)
- [ ] List roles with limit parameter
- [ ] List roles when none exist (should return empty array)
- [ ] List roles when exactly one exists
- [ ] List roles when multiple exist
- [ ] Verify response structure includes correct pagination details
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is correctly associated with returned roles
- [ ] Verify roles are returned with correct permissions
- [ ] Verify roles are returned with correct descriptions

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to list roles with negative/zero limit
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with excessively large limit
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with invalid cursor format
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with malformed request body
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with invalid filter parameters (if supported)

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to list roles without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to list roles with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to list roles from a different workspace (should not be accessible)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow role listing:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permissions for listing roles
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify results match actual database records
- [ ] Verify correct ordering of results
- [ ] Verify pagination works correctly with database queries
- [ ] Verify no sensitive/internal data is exposed in results
- [ ] Verify only roles from the authenticated workspace are returned
- [ ] Verify associated permissions are correctly included

## Edge Cases

- [ ] List roles at pagination boundaries
- [ ] Performance with large number of roles
- [ ] Handle deleted roles correctly (if soft delete is used)
- [ ] Correct handling of Unicode characters in role data
- [ ] List roles with varying numbers of permissions
- [ ] List roles with long descriptions

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for listing with varying numbers of roles
- [ ] Test concurrent requests for role listings
- [ ] Verify performance with different pagination sizes
- [ ] Test performance when filtering or sorting is applied
- [ ] Test performance with roles that have many permissions

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created roles appear in listing
- [ ] Verify deleted roles do not appear in listing
- [ ] Verify updated roles show current data
- [ ] Verify relationship with other endpoints (get role details, etc.)
- [ ] Verify roles with their permissions match individual permission data

## Pagination Testing

- [ ] Verify first page returns expected cursor for next page
- [ ] Verify last page indicates end of results
- [ ] Verify all roles can be retrieved through pagination
- [ ] Verify no duplicate roles across pages
- [ ] Verify consistency when roles are added/removed during pagination
- [ ] Test with minimum page size
- [ ] Test with maximum page size
