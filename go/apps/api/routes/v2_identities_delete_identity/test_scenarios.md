# Test Scenarios for v2_identities_delete_identity

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that deletes an identity.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully delete an identity with valid ID
- [ ] Delete identity by externalId
- [ ] Delete identity without any associated keys
- [ ] Delete identity with associated keys (verify cascade behavior is correct)
- [ ] Verify appropriate success response is returned
- [ ] Verify audit log is created for the deletion
- [ ] Verify all associated resources are properly cleaned up (rate limits, etc.)

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to delete non-existent identity ID
- [ ] Attempt to delete non-existent externalId
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity with invalid ID format
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity with empty ID/externalId
- [ ] Attempt to delete already deleted identity
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity with malformed request
- [ ] Attempt to delete with both ID and externalId (if only one should be used)

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to delete identity without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow identity deletion:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission ("identity.*.delete_identity")
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify identity record is correctly marked as deleted in database
- [ ] Verify associated resources are handled according to deletion policy:
  - [ ] Rate limits
  - [ ] Keys
  - [ ] Other related records
- [ ] Verify delete timestamp is correctly set
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is validated during deletion

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Delete identity with large number of associated resources
- [ ] Delete identity that was just created
- [ ] Delete identity immediately after modifying it
- [ ] Delete identity with active rate limits
- [ ] Attempt to delete identity during high system load
- [ ] Delete identity with the maximum number of associated resources

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Attempt concurrent deletions of the same identity
- [ ] Attempt to use identity while deletion is in progress
- [ ] Test race conditions between deletion and other operations

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for identity deletion
- [ ] Test deletion with varying numbers of associated resources
- [ ] Test system performance when multiple identities are deleted concurrently

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify identity listing endpoint no longer returns deleted identity
- [ ] Verify attempts to use deleted identity fail appropriately
- [ ] Verify analytics record deletion event correctly
- [ ] Verify webhooks trigger correctly on identity deletion (if implemented)
- [ ] Verify audit trail contains complete deletion information
- [ ] Verify metrics are correctly recorded for deletion operations

## Rollback/Recovery Tests

- [ ] Verify behavior for deletion during system failure
- [ ] Test recover/undelete functionality (if implemented)
