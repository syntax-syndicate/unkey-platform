# Test Scenarios for v2_apis_delete_api

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that deletes an API.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [x] Successfully delete an API with valid ID
- [x] Delete API without any associated keys
- [x] Delete API with associated keys (verify cascade behavior is correct)
- [x] Verify appropriate success response is returned
- [x] Verify audit log is created for the deletion
- [x] Delete API with delete protection disabled
- [x] Verify all associated resources are properly cleaned up

## Error Cases

- [x] Attempt to delete non-existent API ID
- [x] Attempt to delete API with invalid ID format
- [x] Attempt to delete API with empty ID
- [x] Attempt to delete API with delete protection enabled
- [x] Attempt to delete already deleted API
- [x] Attempt to delete API with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [x] Attempt to delete API without authentication
- [x] Attempt to delete API with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete API with expired token
- [x] Attempt to delete API with insufficient permissions
- [x] Attempt to delete API from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow API deletion:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [x] Test with specific permission ("api.*.delete_api")
  - [x] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [x] Verify API record is correctly marked as deleted in database
- [x] Verify associated resources are handled according to deletion policy
- [x] Verify delete timestamp is correctly set
- [x] Verify workspace ID is validated during deletion

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Delete API with large number of associated resources
- [x] Delete API that was just created
- [ ] Delete API immediately after modifying it
- [ ] Delete API with active verification requests
- [ ] Attempt to delete API during high system load
- [ ] Delete API with the maximum number of associated resources

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Attempt concurrent deletions of the same API
- [ ] Attempt to use API while deletion is in progress
- [ ] Test race conditions between deletion and other operations

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for API deletion
- [ ] Test deletion with varying numbers of associated resources
- [ ] Test system performance when multiple APIs are deleted concurrently

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify API listing endpoint no longer returns deleted API
- [ ] Verify attempts to use deleted API fail appropriately
- [ ] Verify analytics record deletion event correctly
- [ ] Verify webhooks trigger correctly on API deletion (if implemented)
- [ ] Verify audit trail contains complete deletion information
- [ ] Verify metrics are correctly recorded for deletion operations

## Rollback/Recovery Tests

- [ ] Verify behavior for deletion during system failure
- [ ] Test recover/undelete functionality (if implemented)
