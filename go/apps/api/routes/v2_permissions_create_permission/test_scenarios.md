# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_create_permission

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that creates a new permission in the system.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Create a basic permission with a valid name
- [ ] Create permission with a description
- [ ] Create multiple permissions with different names
- [ ] Create permission with maximum length name
- [ ] Verify permissionId is returned in the response
- [ ] Create hierarchical permission (e.g., "resource.action.operation")
- [ ] Create permission with special characters in the name (if supported)

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to create permission with empty name
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with name shorter than minimum length
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with duplicate name (should return appropriate error)
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with invalid format (if specific format required)
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with invalid JSON in request
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with missing required fields
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with malformed request body

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to create permission without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to create permission with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow permission creation:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission for creating permissions
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify permission record is correctly inserted in the database
- [ ] Verify permission has the correct workspace ID
- [ ] Verify permission has correct name and description
- [ ] Verify permission has non-null created timestamp
- [ ] Verify audit log entry is created for permission creation

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Create permission with name at exactly minimum length
- [ ] Create permission with name at exactly maximum length
- [ ] Create permission with description at maximum length
- [ ] Create permission with Unicode characters in name/description
- [ ] Create permission with similar name to existing permission

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for permission creation
- [ ] Test creating multiple permissions in parallel
- [ ] Test system behavior under load

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify ability to use the created permission in roles
- [ ] Verify ability to use the created permission in authorization checks
- [ ] Verify permission appears in permission listing endpoints
- [ ] Verify permission can be retrieved by its ID
