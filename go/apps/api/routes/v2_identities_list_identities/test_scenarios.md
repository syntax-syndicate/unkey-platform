# Test Scenarios for v2_identities_list_identities

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that lists identities.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] List identities with default pagination (no cursor provided)
- [ ] List identities with pagination (cursor provided)
- [ ] List identities with limit parameter
- [ ] List identities with specific filters (if supported)
- [ ] List identities when none exist (should return empty array)
- [ ] List identities when exactly one exists
- [ ] List identities when multiple exist
- [ ] Verify response structure includes correct pagination details
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is correctly associated with returned identities
- [ ] Verify identities are returned with correct metadata
- [ ] Verify identities are returned with correct rate limit information (if included)

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to list identities with negative/zero limit
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with excessively large limit
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with invalid cursor format
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with malformed request body
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with invalid filter parameters

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to list identities without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to list identities with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to list identities from a different workspace (should not be accessible)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow identities listing:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permissions for listing identities
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify results match actual database records
- [ ] Verify correct ordering of results
- [ ] Verify pagination works correctly with database queries
- [ ] Verify no sensitive/internal data is exposed in results
- [ ] Verify only identities from the authenticated workspace are returned

## Edge Cases

- [ ] List identities at pagination boundaries
- [ ] Behavior with unusual identity metadata
- [ ] Performance with large number of identities
- [ ] Handle identities with deleted status correctly
- [ ] Correct handling of Unicode characters in identity data
- [ ] List identities with varying amounts of associated data (rate limits, keys)

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for listing with varying numbers of identities
- [ ] Test listing identities with large metadata
- [ ] Test concurrent requests for identity listings
- [ ] Verify performance with different pagination sizes
- [ ] Test performance when filtering or sorting is applied

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created identities appear in listing
- [ ] Verify deleted identities do not appear in listing
- [ ] Verify updated identities show current data
- [ ] Verify relationship with other endpoints (get identity details, etc.)

## Pagination Testing

- [ ] Verify first page returns expected cursor for next page
- [ ] Verify last page indicates end of results
- [ ] Verify all identities can be retrieved through pagination
- [ ] Verify no duplicate identities across pages
- [ ] Verify consistency when identities are added/removed during pagination
- [ ] Test with minimum page size
- [ ] Test with maximum page size
