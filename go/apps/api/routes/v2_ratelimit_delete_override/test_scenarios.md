# Test Scenarios for v2_ratelimit_delete_override

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that deletes rate limit overrides.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully delete an existing rate limit override by ID
- [ ] Delete override for a specific identity
- [ ] Delete override for a specific name/resource
- [ ] Verify appropriate success response is returned
- [ ] Verify audit log is created for the deletion
- [ ] Delete override that was recently created
- [ ] Delete the last override for an identity

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to delete non-existent override ID
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with invalid ID format
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with empty ID
- [ ] Attempt to delete already deleted override
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with invalid identity ID
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to delete override without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to delete override with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to delete override from a different workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow override deletion:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission for managing rate limits
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify override record is correctly removed from database
- [ ] Verify associated resources are handled appropriately
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is validated during deletion
- [ ] Verify audit log entry is created for the deletion operation

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Delete override while it's actively being used in rate limiting
- [ ] Delete override that was just created
- [ ] Delete override that was recently updated
- [ ] Delete multiple overrides in succession
- [ ] Delete override during high system load
- [ ] Delete expired override (if applicable)

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Attempt concurrent deletions of the same override
- [ ] Test race conditions between deletion and other operations
- [ ] Test concurrent rate limit operations during override deletion

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for override deletion
- [ ] Test system performance when multiple overrides are deleted concurrently
- [ ] Verify performance impact on rate limiting after override deletion

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify override listing endpoint no longer returns deleted override
- [ ] Verify rate limiting falls back to default behavior after override deletion
- [ ] Verify attempts to get deleted override fail appropriately
- [ ] Verify analytics record deletion event correctly
- [ ] Verify audit trail contains complete deletion information
- [ ] Verify metrics are correctly updated after override deletion
