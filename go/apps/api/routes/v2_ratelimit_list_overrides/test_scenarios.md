# Test Scenarios for v2_ratelimit_list_overrides

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that lists rate limit overrides.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] List overrides with default pagination (no cursor provided)
- [ ] List overrides with pagination (cursor provided)
- [ ] List overrides with limit parameter
- [ ] List overrides filtered by identity (if supported)
- [ ] List overrides filtered by name (if supported)
- [ ] List overrides when none exist (should return empty array)
- [ ] List overrides when exactly one exists
- [ ] List overrides when multiple exist
- [ ] Verify response structure includes correct pagination details
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is correctly associated with returned overrides
- [ ] Verify overrides are returned with correct limit and duration values

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with negative/zero limit
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with excessively large limit
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with invalid cursor format
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with malformed request body
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with invalid filter parameters (if supported)
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with invalid identity ID (if filtering by identity)

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to list overrides without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to list overrides from a different workspace (should not be accessible)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow overrides listing:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permissions for listing overrides
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify results match actual database records
- [ ] Verify correct ordering of results
- [ ] Verify pagination works correctly with database queries
- [ ] Verify no sensitive/internal data is exposed in results
- [ ] Verify only overrides from the authenticated workspace are returned
- [ ] Verify expired overrides are handled correctly (if applicable)

## Edge Cases

- [ ] List overrides at pagination boundaries
- [ ] Performance with large number of overrides
- [ ] Handle deleted overrides correctly (should not be returned)
- [ ] List overrides with varying limit and duration values
- [ ] List overrides with special characters in name
- [ ] List overrides for a specific identity with multiple overrides

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for listing with varying numbers of overrides
- [ ] Test concurrent requests for override listings
- [ ] Verify performance with different pagination sizes
- [ ] Test performance when filtering is applied
- [ ] Test performance during high rate limit activity

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created overrides appear in listing
- [ ] Verify deleted overrides do not appear in listing
- [ ] Verify updated overrides show current data
- [ ] Verify relationship with other endpoints (get override details, etc.)
- [ ] Verify overrides in listing match actual applied rate limits

## Pagination Testing

- [ ] Verify first page returns expected cursor for next page
- [ ] Verify last page indicates end of results
- [ ] Verify all overrides can be retrieved through pagination
- [ ] Verify no duplicate overrides across pages
- [ ] Verify consistency when overrides are added/removed during pagination
- [ ] Test with minimum page size
- [ ] Test with maximum page size
