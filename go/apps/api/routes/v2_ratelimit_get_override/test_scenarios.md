# Test Scenarios for v2_ratelimit_get_override

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that retrieves rate limit overrides.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully retrieve an existing rate limit override by ID
- [ ] Retrieve override for a specific identity
- [ ] Retrieve override for a specific name/resource
- [ ] Verify response structure matches specification
- [ ] Verify all expected fields are returned (ID, identity ID, limit, duration, etc.)
- [ ] Verify timestamps are correctly formatted
- [ ] Verify limit and remaining values are correctly calculated

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to retrieve non-existent override ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with invalid ID format
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with empty ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with invalid identity ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve deleted override (if soft delete is used)
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve override from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow override retrieval:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission for retrieving rate limit overrides
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify returned data matches database record
- [ ] Verify limit values match database values
- [ ] Verify relationships are correctly represented (identity, resource)
- [ ] Verify workspace ID matches the expected workspace

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Retrieve override with very high limit values
- [ ] Retrieve override with very short duration
- [ ] Retrieve override with very long duration
- [ ] Retrieve override with special characters in name
- [ ] Retrieve recently created override
- [ ] Retrieve override that was recently updated
- [ ] Retrieve override near expiration (if applicable)

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for override retrieval
- [ ] Test concurrent retrieval of same override
- [ ] Test retrieval under system load
- [ ] Compare performance with cached vs non-cached responses (if caching is implemented)

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created override can be retrieved immediately
- [ ] Verify changes to override are reflected in subsequent retrievals
- [ ] Verify consistency between list overrides and get override endpoints
- [ ] Verify audit logging works correctly for override retrieval
- [ ] Verify rate limit override properly affects rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Verify metrics are correctly recorded for override operations
