# Test Scenarios for v2_apis_get_api

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that retrieves API details.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [x] Successfully retrieve an existing API by ID
- [x] Retrieve API with all associated fields populated
- [x] Retrieve API with minimal fields populated
- [x] Verify response structure matches specification
- [x] Verify all expected fields are returned (name, ID, creation timestamp, etc.)
- [x] Verify API with auth type "key" returns correct configuration
- [x] Verify API with delete protection enabled shows correct flag

## Error Cases

- [x] Attempt to retrieve non-existent API ID
- [x] Attempt to retrieve API with invalid ID format
- [x] Attempt to retrieve API with empty ID
- [x] Attempt to retrieve deleted API (if soft delete is used)
- [x] Attempt to retrieve API with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [x] Attempt to retrieve API without authentication
- [x] Attempt to retrieve API with invalid authentication
- [ ] ~~Attempt to retrieve API with expired token~~ *(Not applicable - tokens don't have time-based expiration in this implementation)*
- [x] Attempt to retrieve API with insufficient permissions
- [x] Attempt to retrieve API from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [x] Verify correct permissions allow API retrieval:
  - [x] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [x] Test with specific permission ("api.*.get_api")
  - [x] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [x] Verify returned data matches database record
- [x] Verify sensitive fields are not exposed
- [x] Verify timestamps are correctly formatted
- [x] Verify relationships are correctly represented (if applicable)

## Edge Cases

- [x] Retrieve API with very long name
- [x] Retrieve API with special characters in name
- [ ] Retrieve API with edge of time boundary (e.g., during DST change)
- [x] Retrieve API with Unicode characters in fields
- [x] Retrieve recently created API
- [x] Retrieve API that was recently updated

## Performance Tests

> Note: Performance tests were intentionally excluded because they add limited value in their current form 
> and tend to be brittle across different environments. In a real-world project, performance testing 
> would be better implemented as separate load tests with proper benchmarking tools.

- [ ] Measure response time for API retrieval
- [ ] Test concurrent retrieval of same API
- [ ] Test retrieval under system load
- [ ] Compare performance with cached vs non-cached responses (if caching is implemented)

## Integration Tests

- [x] Verify newly created API can be retrieved immediately
- [x] Verify changes to API are reflected in subsequent retrievals
- [ ] Verify consistency between list APIs and get API endpoints
- [ ] Verify audit logging works correctly for API retrieval
- [ ] Verify metrics are correctly recorded for API retrieval operations
