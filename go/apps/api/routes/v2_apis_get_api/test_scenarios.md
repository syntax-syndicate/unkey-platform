# Test Scenarios for v2_apis_get_api

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that retrieves API details.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully retrieve an existing API by ID
- [ ] Retrieve API with all associated fields populated
- [ ] Retrieve API with minimal fields populated
- [ ] Verify response structure matches specification
- [ ] Verify all expected fields are returned (name, ID, creation timestamp, etc.)
- [ ] Verify API with auth type "key" returns correct configuration
- [ ] Verify API with delete protection enabled shows correct flag

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to retrieve non-existent API ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API with invalid ID format
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API with empty ID
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve deleted API (if soft delete is used)
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to retrieve API from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow API retrieval:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission ("api.*.get_api")
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify returned data matches database record
- [ ] Verify sensitive fields are not exposed
- [ ] Verify timestamps are correctly formatted
- [ ] Verify relationships are correctly represented (if applicable)

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Retrieve API with very long name
- [ ] Retrieve API with special characters in name
- [ ] Retrieve API created at edge of time boundary (e.g., during DST change)
- [ ] Retrieve API with Unicode characters in fields
- [ ] Retrieve recently created API
- [ ] Retrieve API that was recently updated

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for API retrieval
- [ ] Test concurrent retrieval of same API
- [ ] Test retrieval under system load
- [ ] Compare performance with cached vs non-cached responses (if caching is implemented)

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created API can be retrieved immediately
- [ ] Verify changes to API are reflected in subsequent retrievals
- [ ] Verify consistency between list APIs and get API endpoints
- [ ] Verify audit logging works correctly for API retrieval
- [ ] Verify metrics are correctly recorded for API retrieval operations
