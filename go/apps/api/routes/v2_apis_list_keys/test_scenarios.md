# Test Scenarios for v2_apis_list_keys

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that lists keys for a specific API.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] List keys with default pagination (no cursor provided)
- [ ] List keys with pagination (cursor provided)
- [ ] List keys with limit parameter
- [ ] List keys with specific filters (if supported)
- [ ] List keys when none exist (should return empty array)
- [ ] List keys when exactly one exists
- [ ] List keys when multiple exist
- [ ] Verify response structure includes correct pagination details
- [ ] Verify API ID is correctly associated with returned keys

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to list keys with non-existent API ID
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with invalid API ID format
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with negative/zero limit
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with excessively large limit
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with invalid cursor format
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with malformed request body

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to list keys without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to list keys with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to list keys from a different workspace (should not be accessible)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow keys listing:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permissions for listing keys
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify results match actual database records
- [ ] Verify correct ordering of results
- [ ] Verify pagination works correctly with database queries
- [ ] Verify no sensitive/internal data is exposed in results

## Edge Cases

- [ ] List keys at pagination boundaries
- [ ] Behavior with unusual key metadata
- [ ] Performance with large number of keys
- [ ] Handle keys with deleted/disabled status correctly
- [ ] Correct handling of Unicode characters in key data

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for listing with varying numbers of keys
- [ ] Test listing keys with large metadata
- [ ] Test concurrent requests for key listings
- [ ] Verify performance with different pagination sizes

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify newly created keys appear in listing
- [ ] Verify deleted keys do not appear in listing
- [ ] Verify disabled keys are displayed correctly
- [ ] Verify updated keys show current data

## Pagination Testing

- [ ] Verify first page returns expected cursor for next page
- [ ] Verify last page indicates end of results
- [ ] Verify all keys can be retrieved through pagination
- [ ] Verify no duplicate keys across pages
- [ ] Verify consistency when keys are added/removed during pagination
