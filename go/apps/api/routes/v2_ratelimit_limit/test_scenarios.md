# Test Scenarios for v2_ratelimit_limit

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that enforces rate limits.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully rate limit a request with default cost
- [ ] Successfully rate limit a request with custom cost
- [ ] Successfully rate limit with specific identifier
- [ ] Rate limit with remaining tokens above the cost
- [ ] Rate limit request that hits exactly the limit
- [ ] Rate limit across multiple requests showing decreasing remaining tokens
- [ ] Rate limit with multiple identifiers showing independent limits
- [ ] Verify rate limit reset timing is accurate
- [ ] Verify limit resets after window expires
- [ ] Rate limit with custom limit parameter

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with missing identifier
- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with invalid limit (negative or zero)
- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with invalid duration (too small)
- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with invalid cost (negative)
- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with malformed request
- [ ] Verify response when rate limit is exceeded

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to rate limit without authentication (if required)
- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to rate limit with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Ensure rate limit information from one tenant cannot be accessed by another

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Test concurrent rate limit requests for the same identifier
- [ ] Verify race conditions are handled properly
- [ ] Test high volume of requests approaching the limit
- [ ] Test behavior when many identifiers are being rate limited simultaneously

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Rate limit with cost exactly equal to remaining tokens
- [ ] Rate limit with cost greater than limit (should fail immediately)
- [ ] Rate limit with extremely high limit values
- [ ] Rate limit with extremely short duration
- [ ] Rate limit with extremely long duration
- [ ] Behavior when system time changes (e.g., daylight saving)

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for rate limit checks
- [ ] Test performance under high load
- [ ] Test performance with many distinct identifiers
- [ ] Test performance with rapid sequential requests

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify rate limits work properly with different backend storage
- [ ] Verify behavior across distributed deployments
- [ ] Verify rate limit consistency across service restarts
- [ ] Verify integration with monitoring and alerting systems

## Consistency and Accuracy Tests

- [ ] Verify rate limit counts are accurate under load
- [ ] Verify rate limit windows slide correctly
- [ ] Verify rate limits are properly isolated between different resources
- [ ] Verify rate limit storage does not leak memory over time

## Observability Tests

- [ ] Verify rate limit metrics are properly recorded
- [ ] Verify logging of rate limit events
- [ ] Verify rate limit dashboards display accurate information
- [ ] Verify rate limit alerting works correctly
