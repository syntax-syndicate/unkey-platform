# Test Scenarios for v2_permissions_delete_permission

This document outlines test scenarios for the API endpoint that deletes a permission.

## Happy Path Scenarios

- [ ] Successfully delete a permission with valid ID
- [ ] Delete permission not currently used by any roles
- [ ] Delete permission with appropriate authorization
- [ ] Verify appropriate success response is returned
- [ ] Verify audit log is created for the deletion
- [ ] Verify all associated resources are properly cleaned up

## Error Cases

- [ ] Attempt to delete non-existent permission ID
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission with invalid ID format
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission with empty ID
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission currently used by one or more roles
- [ ] Attempt to delete already deleted permission
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission with malformed request

## Security Tests

- [ ] Attempt to delete permission without authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission with invalid authentication
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission with expired token
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Attempt to delete permission from another workspace (should be forbidden)
- [ ] Verify correct permissions allow permission deletion:
  - [ ] Test with wildcard permission ("*")
  - [ ] Test with specific permission for deleting permissions
  - [ ] Test with multiple permissions including the required one

## Database Verification

- [ ] Verify permission record is correctly marked as deleted in database
- [ ] Verify role-permission relationships are properly updated
- [ ] Verify delete timestamp is correctly set
- [ ] Verify workspace ID is validated during deletion

## Edge Cases

- [ ] Delete permission used by multiple roles (if allowed)
- [ ] Delete permission that was just created
- [ ] Delete permission with special characters in name
- [ ] Delete multiple permissions in succession
- [ ] Delete permission during high system load

## Concurrency Tests

- [ ] Attempt concurrent deletions of the same permission
- [ ] Test race conditions between deletion and other operations
- [ ] Attempt to use permission while deletion is in progress

## Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure response time for permission deletion
- [ ] Test system performance when multiple permissions are deleted concurrently
- [ ] Verify performance impact on role operations after permission deletion

## Integration Tests

- [ ] Verify permission listing endpoint no longer returns deleted permission
- [ ] Verify attempts to use deleted permission fail appropriately
- [ ] Verify role permission lists are updated correctly
- [ ] Verify analytics record deletion event correctly
- [ ] Verify audit trail contains complete deletion information
- [ ] Verify associated authorization checks no longer include deleted permission

## Rollback/Recovery Tests

- [ ] Verify behavior for deletion during system failure
- [ ] Test recover/undelete functionality (if implemented)
