## Props

The FormSelect component extends all props from the underlying Radix UI Select component, with additional form-specific properties: 

<AutoTypeTable
    name="DocumentedFormSelectProps"
    path="../../internal/ui/src/components/form/index.tsx"
/>

## Accessibility

FormSelect is built with accessibility in mind:

- The FormSelect component uses semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to ensure proper accessibility.
- Labels are properly associated with the select element using `htmlFor` and matching `id` attributes.
- Error and description messages are linked to the select using `aria-describedby`.
- Required state is communicated using `aria-required="true"`.
- Error state is communicated using `aria-invalid="true"`.
- The component leverages Radix UI's Select component which provides keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Color is never the only means of conveying information, with text and icons used to reinforce states.

## Best Practices

When using the FormSelect component:

- Always provide a descriptive label for the select to indicate its purpose.
- Include a helpful description when the selection has important implications or requires explanation.
- Use the `required` or `optional` props to clearly indicate when a selection is necessary.
- Group related form selects together for better organization.
- For selects with many options, consider implementing search functionality or grouping options.
- When appropriate, provide a default selection to reduce user effort.
- Use the error state to provide clear, actionable feedback when validation fails.
- Maintain consistent styling and behavior across all form components in your application.
- Label option groups clearly if using SelectGroup for categorized options.
